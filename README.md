# go-type-generator
Generate valid go types (structs) from JSON.

This tool simplifies the trival yet time taking task of creating Go struct types for complex JSON data. Instead of tediously handcrafting types, just feed it your JSON. It generates valid Go types and saves them in a .txt file.

## WIP
- Support for struct embedding.
- A CLI wrapper around this package.
- Employ interfaces.
